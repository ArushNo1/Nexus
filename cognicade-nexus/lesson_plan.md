# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Fractions

**Subject:** Mathematics  
**Grade:** 3rd  
**Duration:** 45 minutes  
**Standard:** Understand a fraction 1/b as the quantity formed by 1 part when a whole is partitioned into b equal parts.

## Objectives
1. Students manipulate concrete objects to represent fractions.
2. Students identify numerators and denominators.

## Materials
- Fraction circles/tiles
- Pizza cutouts (paper)
- Scissors
- Worksheet: "Fraction Pizza Party"

## Procedures

### Introduction (5 mins)
- Ask: "Who likes pizza?"
- Ask: "If I share a pizza with 3 friends, how do we cut it?"
- Introduce "Equal Shares".

### Activity (25 mins)
1. **Model:** Demonstrate cutting a paper pizza into halves, thirds, fourths.
2. **Practice:** Students cut their own paper pizzas into assigned fractions (1/2, 1/4, 1/8).
3. **Write:** Label each slice with its fraction.

### Conclusion (10 mins)
- Share out: "Show me 1/4 of your pizza!"
- Discuss: Is 1/2 bigger or smaller than 1/8? Why?

## Assessment
- Observation during activity: Are cuts equal?
- Worksheet completion (homework).

## Rubric
| Criteria | Excellent (3) | Good (2) | Needs Improvement (1) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Equal Parts | Parts are perfectly equal | Parts are mostly equal | Parts are unequal |
| Labeling | Correctly labels 1/b | Mostly correct labeling | Incorrect labeling |
