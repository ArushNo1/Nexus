Title: Introduction to Photosynthesis
Duration: 60 minutes
Grade Level: 5th Grade
Subject: Science

Objectives:
- Students will be able to define photosynthesis.
- Students will identify the inputs (sunlight, water, carbon dioxide) and outputs (oxygen, glucose) of photosynthesis.
- Students will explain the importance of photosynthesis for life on Earth.

Standards:
- NGSS 5-LS1-1: Support an argument that plants get the materials they need for growth chiefly from air and water.

Materials Needed:
- Whiteboard and markers
- "The Journey of a Photon" video (link)
- Plant diagram worksheets
- Small potted plant for demonstration

Content:
1. Introduction (10 minutes):
   - Ask students what they ate for breakfast and trace the energy back to plants.
   - Show the potted plant and ask: "How does this plant eat?"
   - Introduce the term "Photosynthesis" (Photo = light, Synthesis = putting together).

2. Procedure (30 minutes):
   - Watch "The Journey of a Photon".
   - draws a diagram on the board showing a plant, sun, rain cloud, and air.
   - Explain the chemical equation in simple terms: Carbon Dioxide + Water + Sunlight -> Glucose (Sugar) + Oxygen.
   - Activity: Students fill out their plant diagram worksheets labeling the parts and arrows.

3. Closure (10 minutes):
   - Quick check: Assessment Game "Thumbs Up/Thumbs Down". (e.g., "Plants need oxygen to make food" - Thumbs Down).
   - Exit Ticket: Write one sentence explaining why humans need plants.

Assessment:
- Formative: participation in Thumbs Up/Thumbs Down.
- Summative: Plant diagram worksheet accuracy.
- Quiz (to be given next class):
  1. What gas do plants take in? (Carbon Dioxide)
  2. What gas do plants release? (Oxygen)
  3. What is the main source of energy for plants? (Sunlight)

Rubric for Worksheet:
- Correctly identifies inputs (3 points)
- Correctly identifies outputs (3 points)
- Neatly colored and labeled (2 points)
- Total: 8 points
