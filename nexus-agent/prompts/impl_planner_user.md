## Game Template Selection & Addon Feature

## Base Template Code ({{ game_type }})

```html
{{ template_code }}
```

Based on the game selection and addon feature above, create a detailed technical plan for:
1. Reskinning every visual element in the template to match the lesson topic
2. Implementing the addon mechanic on top of the existing template code

Reference specific parts of the template code when describing where changes go.

NOTE: Component "lifespan" requires component "opacity". For every object that you're trying to destroy, YOU MUST HAVE OPACITY(). Stop making this stupid mistake.
