## Runtime Test Results (Headless Browser)

The game was loaded in a headless Chromium browser. Here are the results:

```
{{ runtime_results }}
```

## Game Code

```html
{{ game_code }}
```

## Game Design Document

{{ game_design_doc }}

## Lesson Plan

```json
{{ lesson_plan }}
```

Evaluate the game based on the runtime results and your own static analysis. If the browser caught real errors, those are confirmed bugs that MUST be fixed — do not SHIP.
