## Evaluation Rubric

Score each axis 1-5:

1. **Genre Fit** — Does the chosen game type naturally match the lesson's structure and energy? Would a different template be clearly better?
2. **Pedagogical Alignment** — Does the addon feature genuinely teach or test the stated learning objectives? Is it more than superficial theming?
3. **Addon Feasibility** — Can the addon feature be implemented on top of the existing template without major restructuring? Is it scoped appropriately?
4. **Visual Theme Coherence** — Does the proposed re-theming make sense for the topic? Will students immediately understand the connection between the game world and the lesson?
5. **Fun Factor** — Will the addon enhance gameplay rather than interrupt it? Does it feel like a natural part of the game, not a forced quiz?
