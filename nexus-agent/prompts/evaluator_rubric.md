## Evaluation Rubric

Score each axis 1-5:

1. **Pedagogical Alignment** — Do the game mechanics actually teach the stated objectives? Are knowledge checks meaningful?
2. **Fun Factor** — Would a student genuinely want to play this? Is there intrinsic motivation beyond "answer questions"?
3. **Phaser Feasibility** — Can this realistically be built in a single HTML file with Phaser 3? Are the proposed features technically achievable?
4. **Scope Control** — Is the design achievable without exceeding the complexity budget? Could a single LLM code generation pass produce this?
5. **Accessibility** — Is it keyboard navigable? Color-blind safe? Are instructions clear? Is text readable?
