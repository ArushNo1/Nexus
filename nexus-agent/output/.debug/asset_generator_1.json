  "game_design_doc": "GAME_TYPE: maze\n\nRATIONALE: The maze genre is ideal for photosynthesis because the lesson focuses on identifying and gathering specific \"inputs\" while navigating a complex system (the leaf). It rewards the player for differentiating between necessary materials (Sunlight, Water, CO2) and unnecessary or harmful elements.\n\nADDON FEATURE: The Synthesis Sequence\nTo progress or clear a stage, the player must collect one of each \"Input\" item (a Sun icon, a Water droplet, and a CO2 bubble). Once all three inputs are collected, the player enters \"Oxygen Mode\" for 10 seconds; during this time, the player emits a trail of Oxygen bubbles that allows them to \"consume\" the Aphid enemies for bonus points. This mechanic reinforces the causal relationship between specific inputs and the resulting outputs of the photosynthesis process.\n\nVISUAL THEME: The game is set inside a \"Microscopic Leaf Cell,\" with the maze walls represented by green, rectangular plant cell walls. The player is a bright green \"Chloroplast\" character, while the enemies are \"Hungry Aphids\" or \"Pollution Clouds\" that the player must avoid until they have successfully synthesized their energy.",
  "design_feedback": "1. **Genre Fit** \u2014 5: The maze genre perfectly mimics the collection of essential nutrients within a plant structure, mirroring the \"gathering\" aspect of the lesson's inputs.\n2. **Pedagogical Alignment** \u2014 4: The mechanic excellently tests the identification of inputs and the oxygen output, though it misses an opportunity to include \"glucose\" as a secondary reward or objective.\n3. **Addon Feasibility** \u2014 5: Implementing a collection-triggered state change (like a power pellet) is a standard and highly feasible modification for a maze template in Kaplay.js.\n4. **Visual Theme Coherence** \u2014 5: Using a chloroplast character inside a microscopic leaf cell creates an immediate and scientifically accurate mental model of where photosynthesis occurs.\n5. **Fun Factor** \u2014 4: The \"Oxygen Mode\" provides a satisfying power-up reward that makes the educational requirement feel like a core gameplay strategy rather than a chore.\n\nDECISION: PASS",

  "implementation_plan": "This technical plan outlines the transformation of the **Maze Template** into the **\"Chloroplast Quest\"** game, focusing on the photosynthesis process inside a plant cell.\n\n### 1. Visual Reskin Plan\n\nTo align with the \"Microscopic Leaf Cell\" theme, we will modify the constants in `const C` and the maze builder logic.\n\n#### A. Environment & Walls\n*   **Background**: Change `C.bg` to `[10, 40, 10]` (Deep forest green representing the cell interior).\n*   **Walls**: Change `C.wallCol` to `[60, 160, 60]`. In the `switch(ch) case \"#\"` block, increase `outline` thickness to `2` with color `[40, 100, 40]` to simulate thick cellulose cell walls.\n\n#### B. Entities (Characters & Enemies)\n*   **Player (Chloroplast)**: \n    *   Change `playerCol` to `[100, 255, 100]` (Vibrant Green).\n    *   Keep the `bean` sprite (it looks like a chloroplast) but add a `color(...C.playerCol)` component if tinting is needed.\n*   **Enemies (Hungry Aphids)**:\n    *   Change `C.ghostCols` to browns and greys: `[[139, 69, 19], [160, 82, 45], [105, 105, 105]]`.\n    *   Change `C.scaredCol` to `[180, 255, 180]` (Pale green), indicating they are \"oxygenated\" and vulnerable.\n    *   In `spawnGhost()`, change the `rect` to a `circle` or a slightly squashed `ellipse` to look more like a bug.\n\n#### C. Collectibles\n*   **Dots (Nutrients)**: Change `C.dotCol` to `[200, 255, 200]`. These represent basic minerals/nutrients.\n*   **Power Pellets (Inputs)**: These will be replaced by the **Synthesis Sequence** items:\n    *   **Sun**: Yellow circle `[255, 255, 0]` with a \"glow\" effect using `outline(4, rgb(255, 255, 150))`.\n    *   **Water**: Blue droplet shape (or `circle` with `[0, 150, 255]`).\n    *   **CO2**: Greyish-white bubble `[220, 220, 220]`.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Addon Mechanic Implementation Plan: The Synthesis Sequence\n\nWe will modify the \"Power Pellet\" logic to require a set of three specific items before triggering the \"Oxygen Mode.\"\n\n#### Step 1: Initialize Synthesis State\nInside `scene(\"game\")`, add a trac\n...
