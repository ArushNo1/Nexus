GAME_TYPE: platformer

RATIONALE: The lesson is structured chronologically, moving through four distinct historical eras (Ancient Rome, Middle Ages, Industrial Era, and Modern Day). A platformer allows the player to physically progress through these time periods as separate levels, reinforcing the sequential nature of the history.

ADDON FEATURE: Era-Authentic Collection
In each level, the player must collect three specific "Historical Artifacts" mentioned in the text to unlock the exit portal. For example, in the Ancient Rome level, the player must find a "Secret Marriage Scroll," a "Roman Decree," and a "Prisoner’s Letter." When an item is collected, a small text box appears briefly explaining its significance (e.g., "You found Chaucer’s Poem! This 1382 work first linked Valentine’s Day to romance."), ensuring the player connects the gameplay to the historical content.

VISUAL THEME: The player controls a "Historical Messenger" traveling through time. The background and platforms transition from Roman marble columns and temples (Ancient Rome) to stone castles and parchment-style forests (Middle Ages), then to Victorian-style lace-trimmed parlors (19th Century), and finally to a colorful, heart-filled modern candy shop. Enemies change from Roman soldiers to medieval crows to industrial-era printing presses.
