GAME_TYPE: platformer

RATIONALE: A platformer provides a clear, linear progression that mirrors the structure of a test or assessment. It allows for the segmentation of "Test content" into manageable levels, where players must demonstrate mastery of one concept before moving to the next.

ADDON FEATURE: The Knowledge Gate
At the end of each platforming segment, the player encounters two portals labeled with different answers related to the lesson content. To progress to the next level, the player must jump into the portal representing the correct answer; jumping into the incorrect portal triggers a "reboot" effect that sends the player back to the start of the current segment to try again.

VISUAL THEME: The game is set in a "Digital Testing Lab" with a neon-grid aesthetic. The player character is a "Data Probe" (a small hovering robot), and the hazards are "Corrupted Files" (glitching red blocks) that must be avoided while navigating the circuitry-themed platforms.
