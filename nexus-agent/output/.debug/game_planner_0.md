GAME_TYPE: platformer

RATIONALE: The Civil War is best understood as a chronological progression of events and shifting geography, which mirrors the linear movement of a platformer. This genre allows the player to "advance" through the timeline of the war, moving from the causes of the conflict toward its major battles and ultimate resolution.

ADDON FEATURE: Historical Fact Gates
At the end of each level section, the player encounters a "Fortress Gate" blocked by two hanging banners. Each banner displays a historical statement regarding the war’s causes or factions (e.g., "The Confederacy supported States' Rights" vs. "The Union supported the expansion of slavery"). The player must jump through the banner containing the correct historical fact to unlock the gate and proceed; choosing the incorrect banner triggers a "skirmish" (spawns an extra enemy) and requires the player to re-read the prompt.

VISUAL THEME: The player controls a Union soldier navigating 19th-century landscapes, including the woods of Virginia and fortified encampments. Collectibles are "Abolitionist Pamphlets," and hazards include period-accurate obstacles like wooden barricades, cannons, and opposing scouts.
