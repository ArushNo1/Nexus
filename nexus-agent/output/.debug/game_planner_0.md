GAME_TYPE: quizrunner

RATIONALE: The quizrunner format is ideal for 5th graders to practice identifying and categorizing the inputs and outputs of photosynthesis. It reinforces the lesson objectives by requiring players to make split-second decisions to differentiate between what a plant needs (inputs) and what it produces (outputs).

ADDON FEATURE: The Chloroplast Charge
As the player runs, the gates are labeled with different substances (e.g., Oxygen, CO2, Sunlight, Glucose, Vinegar). Passing through a correct "Input" gate (Sunlight, Water, or CO2) fills a "Chloroplast Meter." When the meter is full, the plant enters a "Bloom State" for 5 seconds, turning the character into a flowering plant that automatically attracts "Glucose" coins and leaves behind "Oxygen" trails, visually reinforcing the relationship between inputs and outputs.

VISUAL THEME: The game features a small "Sprout" character running through a vibrant garden ecosystem. Correct gates are represented by glowing suns or refreshing rain clouds, while incorrect gates or obstacles are represented by "Environmental Stressors" like salt piles or thick smoke clouds.
