GAME_TYPE: platformer

RATIONALE: The American Civil War is best taught as a chronological progression of events and shifting tensions. A platformer allows the player to move through "levels" of history, starting with the causes in the early 1800s and progressing toward the war's conclusion, physically representing the passage of time and the obstacles faced by the nation.

ADDON FEATURE: The Legislative Dispatch
Throughout each level, the player must collect "Fact Scrolls" scattered in hard-to-reach places. At the end of the level, the player reaches a "Telegraph Station" (the level exit), which only opens once the player correctly categorizes their collected scrolls into two bins: "Union/North" and "Confederacy/South." This reinforces the lesson's objective of distinguishing between the two sides and their respective economic and political characteristics before they can proceed to the next historical era.

VISUAL THEME: The game is set in the mid-19th century United States, with the background changing from the industrial factories of the North to the agrarian plantations of the South. The player character is a "History Scout" in a Union-style blue cap, and the hazards are "Conflict Clouds" and "Policy Spikes," representing the growing political tensions of the 1860s.
