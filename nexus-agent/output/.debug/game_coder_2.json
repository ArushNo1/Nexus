  "game_design_doc": "GAME_TYPE: shootemup\n\nRATIONALE: The shootemup template is ideal for photosynthesis because the process involves \"capturing\" specific elements (inputs) and \"releasing\" others (outputs). The fast-paced nature of the genre helps students rapidly differentiate between the various molecules and energy sources involved in the process through repetitive recognition.\n\nADDON FEATURE: The Synthesis Gauge\nThe player's character (a green leaf) has a three-part \"Synthesis Gauge\" representing Sunlight, Water, and Carbon Dioxide. Floating icons for all three inputs appear among the enemies; the player must shoot or collide with these specific icons to fill the corresponding segment of the gauge. Once all three inputs are collected, the leaf automatically releases a \"Glucose Blast\" (a powerful screen-clearing attack) and releases Oxygen particles, reinforcing the concept that these specific inputs are required to produce the plant's food and life-sustaining byproduct.\n\nVISUAL THEME: The game is set in a vibrant \"Garden Micro-World\" where the player controls a \"Super-Leaf\" soaring through the air. Enemies are represented as \"Pollution Clouds\" and \"Hungry Aphids,\" while the background transitions from a dark soil-level view to a bright, sun-drenched sky as the player progresses.",
  "design_feedback": "1. **Genre Fit (4/5)**: The shootemup genre provides a high-energy environment for rapid identification, though the distinction between \"shooting\" enemies and \"collecting\" inputs needs careful UI handling to avoid confusion.\n2. **Pedagogical Alignment (5/5)**: The Synthesis Gauge perfectly mirrors the chemical equation of photosynthesis by requiring all three specific inputs to produce the resulting outputs.\n3. **Addon Feasibility (5/5)**: Implementing a segmented gauge and a screen-clearing \"bomb\" effect is well within the technical scope of modifying a Kaplay.js shootemup template.\n4. **Visual Theme Coherence (5/5)**: The \"Garden Micro-World\" and \"Super-Leaf\" protagonist create an immediate and intuitive link to the botanical subject matter.\n5. **Fun Factor (5/5)**: Linking the educational goal (collecting inputs) to a powerful gameplay reward (the Glucose Blast) ensures the learning mechanic is the most exciting part of the game.\n\nDECISION: PASS",
  "design_approved": true,
  "implementation_plan": "This technical plan outlines the transformation of the Shoot 'em Up template into an educational photosynthesis game.\n\n### 1. Visual Reskin Plan\n\nThe \"Garden Micro-World\" theme involves transitioning from a soil-based environment to a bright, sun-lit sky.\n\n| Object | Current (Template) | New (Photosynthesis Theme) | Changes (Code/Visuals) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Player** | `sprite(\"bean\")` | **Super-Leaf** | Use `color(40, 200, 40)` (Green). Add a `text(\"LEAF\")` child for identification. |\n| **Basic Enemy** | Red `rect` | **Pollution Cloud** | Change `col` to `[100, 100, 100]` (Gray). Increase size slightly. |\n| **Fast Enemy** | Yellow `rect` | **Hungry Aphid** | Change `col` to `[180, 200, 50]` (Light Green). Keep zigzag movement. |\n| **Tank Enemy** | Purple `rect` | **Industrial Smog** | Change `col` to `[50, 20, 80]` (Dark Purple). Shoots \"Toxin\" bullets. |\n| **P-Bullet** | Yellow `rect` | **Energy Pulse** | Change `bulletCol` to `[255, 255, 200]` (Bright White/Yellow). |\n| **E-Bullet** | Red `circle` | **Toxin Drop** | Change `enemyBulletCol` to `[80, 50, 20]` (Brown). |\n| **Background** | Dark Blue `[6, 6, 18]` | **The Garden** | Set initial `bg` to `[60, 40, 20]` (Soil). In `onUpdate`, lerp color toward `[135, 206, 235]` (Sky Blue) based on score. |\n| **Stars** | White `circle` | **Pollen/Air Bubbles** | Change `color` to `[255, 255, 200]` with lower opacity and varied `s` (size). |\n| **HUD Text** | Score/Hearts | **Energy/Vitality** | Rename \"Score\" to \"Sugar Produced\". Change heart symbols to small leaf symbols `\"\ud83c\udf3f\"`. |\n\n---\n\n### 2. Addon Mechanic Implementation Plan: The Synthesis Gauge\n\nThis mechanic adds a collection loop that rewards the player with a screen-clearing \"Glucose Blast.\"\n\n#### A. State Variables\nAdd this inside the `scene(\"game\")` scope:\n```javascript\nconst synthesis = {\n    sunlight: false,\n    water: false,\n    co2: false,\n};\nconst gaugeColors = { sunlight: [255, 255, 0], water: [0, 100, 255], co2: [150, 150, 150] };\n```\n\n#### \n...
