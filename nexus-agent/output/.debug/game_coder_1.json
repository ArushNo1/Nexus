  "game_design_doc": "GAME_TYPE: quizrunner\n\nRATIONALE: The quizrunner format is ideal for 5th graders to practice identifying and categorizing the inputs and outputs of photosynthesis. It reinforces the lesson objectives by requiring players to make split-second decisions to differentiate between what a plant needs (inputs) and what it produces (outputs).\n\nADDON FEATURE: The Chloroplast Charge\nAs the player runs, the gates are labeled with different substances (e.g., Oxygen, CO2, Sunlight, Glucose, Vinegar). Passing through a correct \"Input\" gate (Sunlight, Water, or CO2) fills a \"Chloroplast Meter.\" When the meter is full, the plant enters a \"Bloom State\" for 5 seconds, turning the character into a flowering plant that automatically attracts \"Glucose\" coins and leaves behind \"Oxygen\" trails, visually reinforcing the relationship between inputs and outputs.\n\nVISUAL THEME: The game features a small \"Sprout\" character running through a vibrant garden ecosystem. Correct gates are represented by glowing suns or refreshing rain clouds, while incorrect gates or obstacles are represented by \"Environmental Stressors\" like salt piles or thick smoke clouds.",
  "design_feedback": "**1. Genre Fit: 5/5**\nThe quizrunner format perfectly captures the binary \"input vs. non-input\" identification required by the lesson objectives through fast-paced gate selection.\n\n**2. Pedagogical Alignment: 5/5**\nThe Bloom State effectively demonstrates the causal relationship between inputs and outputs, transforming a simple identification quiz into a mini-simulation of the photosynthetic process.\n\n**3. Addon Feasibility: 4/5**\nImplementing a charge meter and a temporary power-up state is technically achievable within the Kaplay.js framework using simple timers and collision masks.\n\n**4. Visual Theme Coherence: 5/5**\nUsing environmental stressors like smoke and salt as obstacles provides a clear, scientifically relevant contrast to the beneficial inputs of sunlight and water.\n\n**5. Fun Factor: 4/5**\nThe transition into a flowering plant with a \"magnet\" effect for glucose coins adds an engaging reward layer that motivates players to hit correct gates rather than just avoiding obstacles.\n\n**DECISION: PASS**",

Visual Reskin Plan\n\nThe game is transformed from a generic runner into a vibrant garden ecosystem where a plant sprout must collect resources to bloom.\n\n#### A. Constants & Environment (`const C`)\n*   **Background Color**: Change `bg` to `[20, 40, 20]` (Deep Forest Green).\n*   **Floor**: Update the floor `rect` color to `[60, 45, 30]` (Rich Soil Brown).\n*   **Lane Lines**: Update `opacity` to `0.15` and color to `[100, 200, 100]` for a \"viny\" look.\n*   **Player Color**: Change `playerCol` to `[50, 200, 50]` (Leaf Green).\n\n#### B. Game Objects\n*   **Player**: \n    *   Represented as a green rectangle with a larger radius (rounded like a seed/sprout).\n    *   When in **Bloom State**, the color changes to `[255, 100, 200]` (Flower Pink) and `scale` increases by 1.2.\n*   **Answer Blocks (Gates)**:\n    *   **Neutral State**: Pale yellow/green `[200, 220, 150]`.\n    *   **Correct (Input)**: Glowing bright yellow `[255, 255, 100]` (Sunlight) or Light Blue `[100, 200, 255]` (Water).\n    *   **Wrong (Stressor)**: Dark Grey `[60, 60, 60]` (Smoke) or White-Grey `[200, 200, 200]` (Salt).\n*   **Decorations**:\n    *   Change `bgstar` to \"Leaf\" shapes or simple circles colored `[40, 80, 40]`.\n\n#### C. Educational Content (`QUESTIONS`)\nUpdate the array to focus on inputs/outputs:\n1.  \"What does a plant need from the Sun?\" -> `[\"Sunlight\", \"Oxygen\", \"Salt\"]`, Correct: 0.\n2.  \"Which gas do plants 'breathe' in?\" -> `[\"Nitrogen\", \"Carbon Dioxide\", \"Hydrogen\"]`, Correct: 1.\n3.  \"Plants drink this through their roots:\" -> `[\"Soda\", \"Vinegar\", \"Water\"]`, Correct: 2.\n4.  \"What sugar do plants make for food?\" -> `[\"Glucose\", \"Salt\", \"Lactose\"]`, Correct: 0.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Addon Mechanic: The Chloroplast Charge\n\n#### A. State Variables\nAdd these to the top of the `scene(\"game\")`:\n```javascript\nlet charge = 0;\n... [truncated, 4414 chars total]",
