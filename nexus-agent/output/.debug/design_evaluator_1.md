**1. Genre Fit: 5/5**
The quizrunner format perfectly captures the binary "input vs. non-input" identification required by the lesson objectives through fast-paced gate selection.

**2. Pedagogical Alignment: 5/5**
The Bloom State effectively demonstrates the causal relationship between inputs and outputs, transforming a simple identification quiz into a mini-simulation of the photosynthetic process.

**3. Addon Feasibility: 4/5**
Implementing a charge meter and a temporary power-up state is technically achievable within the Kaplay.js framework using simple timers and collision masks.

**4. Visual Theme Coherence: 5/5**
Using environmental stressors like smoke and salt as obstacles provides a clear, scientifically relevant contrast to the beneficial inputs of sunlight and water.

**5. Fun Factor: 4/5**
The transition into a flowering plant with a "magnet" effect for glucose coins adds an engaging reward layer that motivates players to hit correct gates rather than just avoiding obstacles.

**DECISION: PASS**
