1. **Genre Fit** (4/5) — The shootemup genre effectively captures the dynamic exchange of molecules, though the "avoidance" of outputs is a slightly artificial game constraint compared to the real biological process.
2. **Pedagogical Alignment** (5/5) — The "Recipe Meter" perfectly reinforces the lesson's goal of distinguishing specific inputs (Sun, Water, CO2) from outputs by making the player actively select one and reject the other.
3. **Addon Feasibility** (5/5) — Implementing a collection-based UI meter and a screen-clearing "Growth Pulse" effect is a standard mechanic that is highly feasible within the Kaplay engine.
4. **Visual Theme Coherence** (4/5) — Using a chloroplast pilot and molecular collectibles creates a strong mental link to cellular biology, though labeling Oxygen as an obstacle to avoid may require a brief explanation to ensure students don't think it's "bad."
5. **Fun Factor** (5/5) — The mechanic turns a core learning objective into a high-stakes "super move" charge-up, making the science feel like an empowering gameplay reward rather than an interruption.

**DECISION: PASS**
