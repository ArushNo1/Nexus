Here's the evaluation of your Game Design Document:

**1. Pedagogical Alignment:** 5/5
The core mechanic of catching inputs and avoiding outputs directly and effectively tests the student's ability to identify photosynthesis components.

**2. Fun Factor:** 3/5
The classic catch/avoid mechanic provides immediate, reaction-based engagement, but the reliance solely on falling text might limit long-term visual appeal and intrinsic motivation for some players.

**3. Kaplay Feasibility:** 5/5
The design leverages Kaplay.js's strengths for programmatic graphics and simple interactions, making it highly achievable within the framework.

**4. Scope Control:** 5/5
The game's minimalist design with limited scenes, objects, and assets perfectly aligns with the specified constraints for a rapid Kaplay.js implementation.

**5. Accessibility:** 3/5
While keyboard input is good, consider explicitly defining text sizes and ensuring any color-coding used for differentiating inputs/outputs is redundant with text labels for color-blind users.
