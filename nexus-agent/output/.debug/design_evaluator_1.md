1. **Genre Fit (4/5)**: The maze format effectively simulates the "gathering" aspect of photosynthesis within a constrained, easy-to-understand environment.
2. **Pedagogical Alignment (5/5)**: The Formula Bar mechanic perfectly reinforces the specific inputs and outputs of photosynthesis by making them the core requirement for game success.
3. **Addon Feasibility (4/5)**: Implementing a collection-based UI bar and a temporary state change for enemies is a manageable extension of the standard maze template's logic.
4. **Visual Theme Coherence (4/5)**: Re-theming the ghosts and pellets into biological components provides a consistent context that reinforces the microscopic leaf setting.
5. **Fun Factor (5/5)**: Turning the "Oxygen Blast" into a strategic reward for completing the formula makes the science feel like a powerful gameplay advantage rather than a chore.

**DECISION: PASS**
