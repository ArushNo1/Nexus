  "game_design_doc": "GAME_TYPE: quizrunner\n\nRATIONALE: The quizrunner format is ideal for 5th graders to practice identifying and categorizing the inputs and outputs of photosynthesis. It reinforces the lesson objectives by requiring players to make split-second decisions to differentiate between what a plant needs (inputs) and what it produces (outputs).\n\nADDON FEATURE: The Chloroplast Charge\nAs the player runs, the gates are labeled with different substances (e.g., Oxygen, CO2, Sunlight, Glucose, Vinegar). Passing through a correct \"Input\" gate (Sunlight, Water, or CO2) fills a \"Chloroplast Meter.\" When the meter is full, the plant enters a \"Bloom State\" for 5 seconds, turning the character into a flowering plant that automatically attracts \"Glucose\" coins and leaves behind \"Oxygen\" trails, visually reinforcing the relationship between inputs and outputs.\n\nVISUAL THEME: The game features a small \"Sprout\" character running through a vibrant garden ecosystem. Correct gates are represented by glowing suns or refreshing rain clouds, while incorrect gates or obstacles are represented by \"Environmental Stressors\" like salt piles or thick smoke clouds.",
  "design_feedback": "**1. Genre Fit: 5/5**\nThe quizrunner format perfectly captures the binary \"input vs. non-input\" identification required by the lesson objectives through fast-paced gate selection.\n\n**2. Pedagogical Alignment: 5/5**\nThe Bloom State effectively demonstrates the causal relationship between inputs and outputs, transforming a simple identification quiz into a mini-simulation of the photosynthetic process.\n\n**3. Addon Feasibility: 4/5**\nImplementing a charge meter and a temporary power-up state is technically achievable within the Kaplay.js framework using simple timers and collision masks.\n\n**4. Visual Theme Coherence: 5/5**\nUsing environmental stressors like smoke and salt as obstacles provides a clear, scientifically relevant contrast to the beneficial inputs of sunlight and water.\n\n**5. Fun Factor: 4/5**\nThe transition into a flowering plant with a \"magnet\" effect for glucose coins adds an engaging reward layer that motivates players to hit correct gates rather than just avoiding obstacles.\n\n**DECISION: PASS**",

Visual Reskin Plan\n\nThe game is transformed from a generic runner into a vibrant garden ecosystem where a plant sprout must collect resources to bloom.\n\n#### A. Constants & Environment (`const C`)\n*   **Background Color**: Change `bg` to `[20, 40, 20]` (Deep Forest Green).\n*   **Floor**: Update the floor `rect` color to `[60, 45, 30]` (Rich Soil Brown).\n*   **Lane Lines**: Update `opacity` to `0.15` and color to `[100, 200, 100]` for a \"viny\" look.\n*   **Player Color**: Change `playerCol` to `[50, 200, 50]` (Leaf Green).\n\n#### B. Game Objects\n*   **Player**: \n    *   Represented as a green rectangle with a larger radius (rounded like a seed/sprout).\n    *   When in **Bloom State**, the color changes to `[255, 100, 200]` (Flower Pink) and `scale` increases by 1.2.\n*   **Answer Blocks (Gates)**:\n    *   **Neutral State**: Pale yellow/green `[200, 220, 150]`.\n    *   **Correct (Input)**: Glowing bright yellow `[255, 255, 100]` (Sunlight) or Light Blue `[100, 200, 255]` (Water).\n    *   **Wrong (Stressor)**: Dark Grey `[60, 60, 60]` (Smoke) or White-Grey `[200, 200, 200]` (Salt).\n*   **Decorations**:\n    *   Change `bgstar` to \"Leaf\" shapes or simple circles colored `[40, 80, 40]`.\n\n#### C. Educational Content (`QUESTIONS`)\nUpdate the array to focus on inputs/outputs:\n1.  \"What does a plant need from the Sun?\" -> `[\"Sunlight\", \"Oxygen\", \"Salt\"]`, Correct: 0.\n2.  \"Which gas do plants 'breathe' in?\" -> `[\"Nitrogen\", \"Carbon Dioxide\", \"Hydrogen\"]`, Correct: 1.\n3.  \"Plants drink this through their roots:\" -> `[\"Soda\", \"Vinegar\", \"Water\"]`, Correct: 2.\n4.  \"What sugar do plants make for food?\" -> `[\"Glucose\", \"Salt\", \"Lactose\"]`, Correct: 0.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Addon Mechanic: The Chloroplast Charge\n\n#### A. State Variables\nAdd these to the top of the `scene(\"game\")`:\n```javascript\nlet charge = 0;\n... [truncated, 4414 chars total]",

  "playtest_report": "# Quality Assurance Report: Photosynthesis Run - Chloroplast Charge\n\n## 1. Static Analysis\n- **HTML Structure**: Valid.\n- **CDN Link**: Correct (Kaplay 3001).\n- **JavaScript Syntax**: Valid, but contains a logical collision in component definitions.\n- **Reference Integrity**: All scenes and objects are defined.\n- **Score: 2/5** (Docked significantly for a runtime-breaking component error).\n\n## 2. Code Quality Review\n- **Initialization**: `kaplay()` is configured correctly.\n- **Scene Management**: Scenes are well-defined and transitions (`go()`) are handled.\n- **Performance**: The use of `onUpdate` for lane movement and `loop` for spawning is efficient.\n- **Error Handling**: The code contains a critical error identified by the runtime tester: `Duplicate component property: \"width\"`.\n    - **Origin**: In the definition of `chargeBar` (Line 247), the developer adds the `rect()` component (which provides a `width` property) and then attempts to add a custom object `{ width: 0 }`. In Kaplay.js, this causes an immediate crash because component properties cannot be overwritten in this manner.\n- **Score: 2/5**\n\n## 3. Educational Alignment\n- **GDD Match**: The game perfectly implements the \"Chloroplast Charge\" addon and the \"Bloom State\".\n- **Learning Objectives**: The questions accurately cover photosynthesis inputs (CO2, H2O, Sunlight) and outputs (Oxygen, Glucose).\n- **Knowledge Gates**: The lane-switching quiz mechanics provide effective active recall.\n- **Documentation**: The header block is present and accurate.\n- **Score: 5/5**\n\n## 4. Playability Assessment\n- **State Flow**: Clear start, game-over, and win conditions.\n- **Controls**: Clearly displayed on screen.\n- **UI/UX**: The \"Bloom State\" provides great visual feedback for mastery.\n- **Tracking**: Scoring and health are tracked and displayed.\n- **Score: 4/5** (Logic is sound, but playability is zero due to the crash).\n\n---\n\n## ERRORS:\n1.  **Duplicate Property Crash**: Line 247 contains `rect(0, 16, ...)` followed \n...
