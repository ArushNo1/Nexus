  "game_design_doc": "GAME_TYPE: platformer\n\nRATIONALE: A platformer provides a clear linear progression that mirrors the chronological timeline of the Civil War. It allows the player to move through \"levels\" of history, starting with the causes and progressing toward the outcomes and significance of the conflict.\n\nADDON FEATURE: The Cause-Collector Gates\nTo pass through the checkpoint at the end of each level, the player must collect three specific \"Cause Scrolls\" hidden throughout the platforming map. These scrolls are labeled with the actual causes of the war (Slavery, States' Rights, and Economic Differences); if the player picks up a \"Distractor Scroll\" (e.g., \"Space Travel\" or \"The Great Depression\"), they are slowed down or lose a life, and the final gate will not open. This forces students to actively read and identify the correct historical drivers of the war while navigating the environment.\n\nVISUAL THEME: The game is set in a 19th-century aesthetic featuring parchment-textured backgrounds and \"sepia-tone\" environments. The player character is a \"Historical Messenger\" navigating through iconic settings like a 1860s rail yard, a colonial-style town square, and the steps of the U.S. Capitol, while avoiding obstacles like \"Tumbleweeds of Time\" and \"Clouds of Misinformation.\"",
  "design_feedback": "1. **Genre Fit (4/5)** \u2014 The platformer's linear progression effectively mirrors historical timelines, providing a clear path from the causes to the outcomes of the war.\n2. **Pedagogical Alignment (5/5)** \u2014 The Cause-Collector Gates directly assess the primary lesson objective of identifying the specific causes of the Civil War through active discernment.\n3. **Addon Feasibility (5/5)** \u2014 Implementing collectible logic and conditional gate requirements is a straightforward and highly efficient use of the Kaplay.js platformer template.\n4. **Visual Theme Coherence (5/5)** \u2014 The sepia-toned aesthetic and 19th-century motifs create an immersive historical atmosphere that perfectly aligns with the 1860s subject matter.\n5. **Fun Factor (4/5)** \u2014 The scavenger-hunt mechanic adds a layer of engagement to the platforming, though you must ensure the \"distractor\" text is large enough to read while moving.\n\n**DECISION: PASS**",

Visual Reskin Plan\n\nTo achieve the 19th-century \"sepia-tone\" parchment aesthetic, we will modify the `CONFIG` object and the object definitions within `buildLevel`.\n\n**Color Palette & Aesthetics (CONFIG)**\n- **Background (`bgColor`)**: Change from `[18, 18, 42]` to `[225, 205, 170]` (Parchment Tan).\n- **Floor (`floorColor`)**: Change from `[60, 180, 120]` to `[101, 67, 33]` (Dark Wood/Soil).\n- **Platform (`platformColor`)**: Change from `[80, 140, 200]` to `[160, 130, 90]` (Weathered Wood).\n- **Hazard (`hazardColor`)**: Change from `[220, 60, 80]` to `[85, 65, 45]` (Tumbleweed Brown).\n- **Coin/Scroll (`coinColor`)**: Change from `[255, 210, 50]` to `[245, 245, 220]` (Off-white Paper).\n- **Portal (`portalColor`)**: Change from `[180, 80, 255]` to `[100, 100, 100]` (Initially \"Locked\" Gray).\n\n**Game Object Reskinning**\n- **Player**: Replace `sprite(\"bean\")` with a `rect` (24x32) colored `[40, 40, 40]` (Messenger Silhouette) with an `outline(2, rgb(0, 0, 0))`.\n- **Collectibles ($)**: \n    - Change from `circle(10)` to `rect(20, 25)`.\n    - Add a child `text` object to display the cause name (e.g., \"Slavery\").\n- **Hazards (^)**:\n    - Change from sharp triangles to `circle(12)` with `outline(4, rgb(50, 30, 0))` to represent \"Tumbleweeds of Time.\"\n- **Exit Portal (>)**:\n    - Change visual to a tall `rect(40, 60)` representing the \"U.S. Capitol\" or a \"Telegraph Office.\"\n- **HUD Labels**:\n    - `scoreLabel`: Change \"Coins\" to \"Cause Scrolls.\"\n    - `hpLabel`: Change \"HP\" to \"History Integrity.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. Addon Mechanic Implementation Plan: Cause-Collector Gates\n\nThis mechanic requires the player to collect 3 specific scrolls while avoiding distractor scrolls to unlock the exit.\n\n**A.

  "playtest_report": "# Evaluation Report: The Historical Messenger: Civil War Causes\n\n## 1. Static Analysis (Score: 3/5)\n- **HTML Structure:** Valid.\n- **CDN Link:** Correct (`kaplay@3001`).\n- **Syntax Errors:** No obvious syntax syntax errors, but several **ReferenceErrors** exist due to the use of non-existent Kaplay functions.\n- **Component Definition:** Valid use of standard components (`pos`, `rect`, `area`, `body`).\n\n## 2. Code Quality Review (Score: 2/5)\n- **Initialization:** `kaplay()` config is well-defined.\n- **Logic Issues:**\n    - **CRITICAL ERROR:** The code uses `getCamPos()` and `setCamPos()`. These are not standard Kaplay.js functions. In Kaplay, the camera is controlled via `camPos()`. This will cause the game to crash the moment the `player.onUpdate` loop runs (i.e., immediately upon starting).\n    - **CRITICAL ERROR:** The function `flash()` is used in the `hazard` collision logic. `flash` is not a global Kaplay function; this will cause a crash when the player hits a hazard.\n    - **POTENTIAL ERROR:** `new Rect(vec2(-10, -10), 20, 20)` is used for hazard collision. While `Rect` exists internally, the standard API for custom area shapes in Kaplay is usually `rect(x, y, w, h)`.\n- **Performance:** No infinite loops, though the headless browser reported GPU stalls during `ReadPixels`, likely related to the sepia-toned rendering or high-frequency camera interpolation.\n\n## 3. Educational Alignment (Score: 5/5)\n- **GDD Match:** Perfectly aligns with the \"Historical Messenger\" concept and \"Cause-Collector Gates\" mechanic.\n- **Learning Objectives:** Integrated directly into gameplay (Slavery, States' Rights, Economics vs. distractors).\n- **Knowledge Gates:** The \"Deck System\" is an excellent implementation to prevent soft-locks while ensuring educational mastery (3 correct causes required to open the portal).\n- **Theme:** The Sepia/Parchment visual theme is well-represented in the code.\n\n## 4. Playability Assessment (Score: 3/5)\n- **Controls:** Clearly documented on screen.\n-\n... [truncated, 3479 chars total]",
