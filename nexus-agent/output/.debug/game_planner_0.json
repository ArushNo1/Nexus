  "game_design_doc": "# Game Design Document: Photosynthesis Factory\n\n## Core Concept\n- **Genre**: Resource Collection/Matching\n- **Description**: Players drag inputs (sunlight, water, CO2) into a plant factory to create outputs (oxygen, glucose) while learning the photosynthesis equation.\n- **Target play time**: 3-4 minutes\n\n## Learning Integration\n- **Objective 1 (Define photosynthesis)**: Game intro text explains \"photosynthesis is how plants make food from simple materials\"\n- **Objective 2 (Identify inputs/outputs)**: Core mechanic requires dragging correct inputs (sun, water drop, CO2 bubble) to produce outputs (oxygen bubble, glucose crystal)\n- **Objective 3 (Importance for life)**: Score feedback emphasizes \"You helped plants make oxygen for animals to breathe!\"\n\n**Knowledge checks**:\n1. **Input Recognition**: Players must identify and drag only correct inputs\n2. **Output Prediction**: Players see what they created and learn the connection\n\n## Phaser Architecture\n\n### Scenes (2 total)\n1. **GameScene**: Main gameplay with plant factory\n2. **ResultsScene**: Score and learning summary\n\n### Key Game Objects (4 types)\n1. **Plant Sprite**: Central factory (green rectangle with leaves)\n2. **Input Items**: Draggable sprites (sun=yellow circle, water=blue drop, CO2=gray bubble)\n3. **Output Items**: Generated sprites (oxygen=green bubble, glucose=brown hexagon)\n4. **UI Elements**: Score text, timer, instructions\n\n### Input & Mechanics\n- **Primary Input**: Mouse drag-and-drop\n- **Game Loop**: \n  - Random inputs spawn at screen edges\n  - Player drags inputs to plant center\n  - Correct combinations create outputs and points\n  - Wrong items disappear with no penalty\n  - 60-second timer\n\n### Score Tracking\n- +10 points per correct input delivered\n- +20 bonus when complete set (sun + water + CO2) creates both outputs\n- Display running total and final score with encouraging messages\n\n## Assets Needed\n\n### Graphics (Programmatic only)\n- Plant: Green rectangle (100x150px) with simple leaf shapes\n- S\n...
