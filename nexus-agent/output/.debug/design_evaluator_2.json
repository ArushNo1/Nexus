  "game_design_doc": "# Game Design Document: Photosynthesis Factory\n\n## Core Concept\n- **Genre:** Drag-and-drop puzzle with factory simulation elements\n- **Description:** Students manage a plant \"factory\" by dragging the correct inputs (sunlight, water, CO\u2082) to create outputs (oxygen, glucose) while learning the photosynthesis process\n- **Target play time:** 3-4 minutes per session\n\n## Learning Integration\n- **Objective 1** (Define photosynthesis): Reinforced through interactive tutorial and success messages that explicitly state \"This is photosynthesis - plants making their own food!\"\n- **Objective 2** (Identify inputs/outputs): Core drag-and-drop mechanic requires recognizing and correctly placing all 3 inputs to generate 2 outputs\n- **Objective 3** (Explain importance): Success feedback connects plant oxygen production to \"the air we breathe\" and glucose to \"plant food for growth\"\n\n**Knowledge Checks:**\n1. **Recognition test:** Players must identify correct input shapes/labels before dragging\n2. **Process understanding:** Only complete input combinations (sun + water + CO\u2082) produce outputs, teaching the requirement for all three\n\n## Phaser Architecture\n\n### Scenes\n1. **MenuScene:** Instructions with accessibility options toggle\n2. **GameScene:** Main factory gameplay (60-second timer)\n\n### Key Game Objects\n1. **InputDropper:** Generates falling input items (sun, water drop, CO\u2082 bubble)\n2. **Plant:** Central factory that accepts inputs and produces outputs\n3. **ScoreManager:** Tracks correct combinations and provides educational feedback\n4. **AccessibilityManager:** Handles keyboard navigation and visual alternatives\n\n### Input System\n- **Primary:** Mouse drag-and-drop\n- **Accessibility Alternative:** Arrow keys to select items + WASD to move + Spacebar to drop\n- **Visual Focus:** Clear selection borders for keyboard users\n\n### Score Tracking\n- +10 points per correct input placement\n- +50 bonus for complete photosynthesis cycle (all 3 inputs \u2192 both outputs)\n- Educational pop-ups expla\n...

  "design_feedback": "## Evaluation of \"Photosynthesis Factory\" Game Design Document\n\n### 1. Pedagogical Alignment: **4/5**\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Excellent direct mapping to all three lesson objectives through core mechanics\n- Drag-and-drop mechanic naturally teaches input/output identification (Objective 2)\n- Educational feedback explicitly connects outputs to real-world importance (Objective 3)\n- Knowledge checks are meaningful - requiring all 3 inputs to produce outputs teaches the complete process\n- Success messages reinforce the definition of photosynthesis (Objective 1)\n\n**Areas for improvement:**\n- Could benefit from more explicit assessment alignment with the quiz questions (CO\u2082 intake, O\u2082 release, sunlight as energy source)\n- The factory metaphor, while engaging, could be supplemented with brief connections to actual plant biology\n\n### 2. Fun Factor: **4/5**\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Factory simulation concept is inherently engaging and age-appropriate\n- Clear progression system with immediate feedback rewards\n- Bonus points for complete cycles create satisfying gameplay loops\n- Visual and audio feedback makes interactions feel responsive\n- Time pressure (60 seconds) adds appropriate challenge without stress\n\n**Minor concerns:**\n- Single-screen, single-plant design might feel repetitive after initial novelty\n- Limited variation in gameplay mechanics could reduce replay value\n\n### 3. Phaser Feasibility: **5/5**\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Extremely well-scoped for Phaser 3 capabilities\n- All graphics use programmatic drawing (Graphics API) - no external assets needed\n- Drag-and-drop is a core Phaser strength with built-in pointer events\n- Scene structure is simple and appropriate\n- Technical specifications are realistic (450-500 lines, single HTML file)\n- No complex physics or animations required\n\n**Technical soundness:**\n- Architecture clearly separates concerns (InputDropper, Plant, ScoreManager)\n- Accessibility system is well-planned and technically achievable\n\n### 4. Scope Control: **5/5**\n\n**Stre\n... [truncated, 4293 chars total]",
