GAME_TYPE: shootemup

RATIONALE: The shootemup genre is ideal for photosynthesis because it mirrors the constant, rapid bombardment of molecules and energy a leaf experiences. It requires students to perform rapid identification and categorization of "Inputs" versus "Outputs" in a high-energy environment.

ADDON FEATURE: The Photosynthesis Recipe Meter
A UI meter tracks three specific "Input" slots: Sunlight, Water, and Carbon Dioxide. The player must fly into these specific items as they fall down the screen to fill the slots; however, "Output" items (Oxygen and Glucose) also fall and must be avoided. Once all three inputs are collected, the player’s ship (the Chloroplast) automatically emits a "Growth Pulse" that clears all "Pollution" enemies on screen and earns a point, reinforcing that these three specific ingredients are required to produce a result.

VISUAL THEME: The player controls a "Super Chloroplast" craft navigating the microscopic interior of a leaf cell. Enemies are dark "Smog Clouds" and "Pests," while the items to collect or avoid are bright yellow Suns, blue Water droplets, grey CO2 molecules, and hexagonal Glucose sugars.
