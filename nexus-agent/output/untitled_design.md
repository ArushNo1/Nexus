GAME_TYPE: maze

RATIONALE: The maze template is ideal for photosynthesis because it mirrors the process of a plant searching for and absorbing specific nutrients. The navigation-based gameplay simulates how a plant must "gather" its necessary components (sunlight, water, CO2) from its environment to survive and grow.

ADDON FEATURE: The Photosynthesis Formula Bar
In this mechanic, the player's primary goal is to fill a "Formula Bar" at the top of the screen by collecting three specific types of items in any order: a Water Drop, a Sunlight Spark, and a Carbon Dioxide Bubble. Once all three inputs are collected, the bar flashes, and the player releases an "Oxygen Blast" (functioning like a power pellet) that turns enemies into "Glucose" points for 10 seconds. This reinforces the specific inputs required for photosynthesis and the resulting outputs of oxygen and sugar.

VISUAL THEME: The game is set inside the microscopic world of a "Leaf Cell," with walls made of green plant cell structures. The player controls "Sunny the Seedling," while the "ghosts" are re-themed as "Pollution Clouds" and "Thirsty Aphids." The small dots usually found in a maze are replaced with "Nutrient Pellets," and the four power-ups are represented by large glowing "Chlorophyll" molecules.
