GAME_TYPE: platformer

RATIONALE: A platformer is ideal for history because it allows for a chronological progression through time. The level design can physically represent a timeline, moving the player from the causes of the war in the early stages to the key battles and eventually the resolution.

ADDON FEATURE: The Fact-Check Bridge
At three specific points in each level, the player reaches a gap that can only be crossed by jumping onto one of two floating platforms. Each platform is labeled with a statement (e.g., Platform A: "The Union supported slavery" vs. Platform B: "The Confederacy supported slavery"). If the player lands on the historically accurate platform, it stays solid and allows them to cross; if they land on the incorrect one, it vanishes, and the player falls to a lower checkpoint where they must re-read a "History Scroll" to try again.

VISUAL THEME: The game is set in the 1860s, featuring a "parchment paper" aesthetic for the background. The player character is a stylized Union scout traveling through environments that transition from the industrial North (brick factories and telegraph lines) to the agrarian South (fields and fences) as the levels progress.
